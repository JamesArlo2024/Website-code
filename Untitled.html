      - This was made on Day 2
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Now day number 3. Creating Line breaks and continuing with
      formatting the text. I am creating a longer paragraph here because I want
      to see what it looks like on the actual website when I do it like this.
      Today I will also be adding links. Please look at the website for update
      logs and change logs
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another paragraph that I have completed however this one is
      different from all the others as this one is to test the link coding for
      this website. For this test I have connected it up to my Youtube channel.
      Check it out
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JamesArloGaming">Here</a>

      UPDATE MADE!!!!! - Also on day 3 I have changed the title of the site.
      However this is not to be confused with the title of the page. The title
      of the page is the title of the information that you are looking at right
      now which is called James Arlo, however if you look at the tab within your
      browser it should be called James Arlo - Development site
